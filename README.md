# User Guide

## Calibration

It is important to ensure that the eye tracker is properly calibrated because this will affect the overall perfomance and accuracy of the software. The tracker should be calibrated using it's own calibration software before launching this software

## Performing An Action
The functions are listed on the toolbar to the right of the screen and can be activated by briefly gazing at the selected action.

#### Clicking

Right-click, left-click, double-click and scroll are the main functions and are found on the toolbar on the right of the screen. 

#### Gaze Mode

In Gaze Mode once the action has been activated gaze at a protion of the screen where you want the action to take place, this will zoom in to improve accuracy where the user can gaze once more to finally click on-screen.

#### Switch Mode

In Switch Mode the user selecets an action in the same way, but it removes the need to gaze where an action is supposed to happen. Instead the user can press the switch key to make the action happen where the user is currently looking e.g. look at screen - press switch to zoom in - press the switch again to perform the action.

#### Scrolling

The scroll function works similarly to clicking, once the action has begun the user can control the movement of the page by moving their eyes up or down the screen to perform a scroll.

## Adjusting The Settings

Adjusting the settings by selecting the settings icon on the gaze toolbar, or right click on the notify icon and then select settings.
